    validator.w3.org: Website for validating HTML code
    Code was run through validator.w3.org:
    Immediate first errors:
        Consider adding a lang attribute to the html start tag
        Character encoding was not declared
        Start tag was seen without seeing a doctype first
    
    "<html>" is a tag
    "<html></html>" considered an element;
        definition includes everything from starting tag, information contained, ending tag
    Tag and element are often interchanged
    head is the metadata tag; information not seen on website
    
    LESSON 1 CHANGES AND VALIDATION RESULTS

    Adding "<!DOCTYPE html> "FIXES DOCTYPE ERROR | Must have for all html files
    Adding "<html lang="en">" -US or -GB are also options ||| FIXES LANG ERROR
    Adding "<meta charset="utf-8">" specifically 1024 bytes after beginning of document
        FIXES CHARACTER ENCODING ERROR

    Typical meta tags that contain metadata for the page
